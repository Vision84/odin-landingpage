# odin-landingpage

This is my Landing Page for The Odin Project. This was actually somewhat easy once I figured out that I could use a flexbox literally everywhere. 

One thing that was somewhat weird was the difference between span and div. With my CSS, there were weird functionality with divs making me use span instead. 

This was a fun project, and helped me with using flexboxes more comfortably.
